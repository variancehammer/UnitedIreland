# United Ireland for Bolt Action
Musings, backstory and eventually rules for a non-neutral Ireland in WWII for Bolt Action

## Core Idea
Some folks in my local club want to play Bolt Action. I'm not really sure what I want to play, but I am in my heart of hearts something of a contrarian. I've already got a Chain of Command airborne army. I want something else, and I'd like it to be flexible.

Enter my favorite "first time through a Paradox game" nation - Ireland. They remained neutral in WWII, albeit with a sort of Allied sympathetic approach. But what if they hadn't?
