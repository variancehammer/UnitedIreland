# United Ireland for Bolt Action
Musings, backstory and eventually rules for a non-neutral Ireland in WWII for Bolt Action

## Core Idea ##
Some folks in my local club want to play Bolt Action. I'm not really sure what I want to play, but I am in my heart of hearts something of a contrarian. I've already got a Chain of Command airborne army. I want something else, and I'd like it to be flexible.

Enter my favorite "first time through a Paradox game" nation - Ireland. They remained neutral in WWII, albeit with a sort of Allied sympathetic approach. But what if they hadn't?

## Contents (Under Construction) ##
* Timeline.md - A timeline of "past events" for Ireland's entry and participation in the war
* EarlyWar.md - Rules and units for early-war Ireland
* MidWar.md - Rules and units for mid-war Ireland
* LateWar.md - Rules and units for late-war and/or WWII to WWIII spillover conflicts (these are the invariable end of most Hearts of Iron games that end in an allied victory on anywhere approaching the historical timeline)
